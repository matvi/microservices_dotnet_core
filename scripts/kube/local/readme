This scripts are made to load the images into local kubernetes.

Tested in windows hiperv and Debian9 in minikube cluster with kv2.

To run this tests you need to build the images using the ks8.Dockerfile that will use the appserttings.ks8.json that is located in each project.
Once you build the images you need to publish them.

After the images are published you need to run the scripts in the next order.

1. local-PV that creates the local persistet volume that will allow mongoDb to persiste the data
2. mongo-statefulset.yaml this file creates a headless service and creates a statefulset to deploy mongo allowing us to access mongo database using dns name mongo-0.mongo
    it also creates a PVC that will connect with the local-PV that we created in the first deploy.
3. rabbitmq-statefulset.yaml this files creates a headless service for rabbitmq and also a statefulset for rabbitmq server.
4. actioApi_deployment deploys ActioApi.
5. actioServiceActivities_deployment deploys Actio activities service .
6. actioServiceIdentity_deployment deploys Actio identity server service.
7.- mongo-nodePortService cretes a NodePort service to be able to access the mongo Db server from outside the cluster.
